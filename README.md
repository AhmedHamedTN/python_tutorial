# A Python Tutorial:
This is code I wrote for some courses I teach at Indiana University.
The code in this tutorial is meant for Python beginners, and is written primarily in Python 2.7.
A migration to Python 3 shoul be straightforward.
A lot of the code I write and run during class sessions and so it is shared without much polishing.
I provide some comments, before I push here, as much as I can.
