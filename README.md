# A Python Tutorial:
This is code I wrote for courses I teach at Indiana University.
The code in this tutorial is meant for Python beginners, although some of it will be useful for intermediate level learners.
In later parts, I should be able to push more advanced parts including ones that can be used for natural language processing and machine learning.

The code is written primarily in Python 2.7.
A migration to Python 3 shoul be straightforward.
A lot of the code I write and run during class sessions and so it is shared without much polishing.
I provide some comments, before I push here, as much as I can.
